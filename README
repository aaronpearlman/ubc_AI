UBC AI project (pfd AI part)
by Aaron Berndsen and Weiwei Zhu

NEW! The PICS AI now support the .ar2 file format from psrchive.
For this to work you need to install psrchive's python module:
INSTALL psrchive with
    configure --enable-shared
make sure to add $PSRHOME/lib/python2.X/site-packages/ to your PYTHONPATH.
This is now required when dealing with only pfd files.

TO USE THIS CODE YOU NEED TO INSTALL:
    PRESTO (make sure to include the presto python library in your $PYTHONPATH)
    sklearn (python package, version 0.12.1)
    libblas-dev
    theano (python)
    python-dev

TO INSTALL the packages:
    apt-get install python-dev
    apt-get install libblas-dev
    easy_install scikit-learn==0.12.1
    easy_install theano

TO USE OUR PICKLED CLASSIFIERS:
***The following code is from the quickclf.py code in the repo, this code classifer all .pfd file in the current workign directory and save teh result to clfresult.txt. One can then open up and inspect the result using: python pfdviewr.py clfresult.txt

import cPickle, glob, ubc_AI
from ubc_AI.data import pfdreader
AI_PATH = '/'.join(ubc_AI.__file__.split('/')[:-1])
classifier = cPickle.load(open(AI_PATH+'/trained_AI/clfl2_BD.pkl','rb'))
pfdfile = glob.glob('*.pfd')
AI_scores = classifier.report_score([pfdreader(f) for f in pfdfile])
text = '\n'.join(['%s %s' % (pfdfile[i], AI_scores[i]) for i in range(len(pf    dfile))])
fout = open('clfresult.txt', 'w')
fout.write(text)
fout.close()
